        We employ a sophisticated approach to identify and analyze the latest fashion trends. The process involves the following steps:

        1. **Data Collection**: We start by gathering fashion images from reputable sources like *Pinterest* and *Vogue* through web scraping.

        2. **Object Detection**: We use YOLOv8, a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm, to create bounding boxes around clothing items in the images.

        3. **Item Extraction**: The clothing items are then extracted from the images for further analysis.

        4. **Similarity Scoring**: We employ cosine similarity to find products in our database that resemble the extracted items. Each product is assigned a logarithmic score based on its similarity to the trend.

        5. **Periodic Updates**: This entire process is carried out periodically (once per month) to keep our trend insights up-to-date.
